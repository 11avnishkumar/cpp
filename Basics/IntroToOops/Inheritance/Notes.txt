Inheritance

Technical definition: it is the processing of inheriting the memeber and method of the class
to another class.

Base class: The class from which the new class will inherit.
Derived class: The new class which will form after inheriting from the base class.

Advantages of inheritance:
* Reusability
* Time saving

An example of Base class and derived class

class Base(){

    public:
    void display(){
        cout<<"display base"<<endl;
    }

};

class Derived:public Base(){
// This class is inherited publically
// Now this class can access the display function
// There is lot's of features that could be added here

}

int main(){
    // calling the base class
    base d;
    d.display()

    //calling the derived class
    derived d2;
    d2.display()
}
