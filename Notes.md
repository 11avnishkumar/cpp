# Programming using CPP and Datastructure

## What is a data structure?

Data Structure is -
A techninque to store elements so that they can be used efficiently and effectively.

## Recursion

* what is Recursion?

  * When a function call itself then it is called recursion.

  * Recursion is costly because it uses stack internally.

## Array

* Array stores element in memory at contigious location.

* If we are not sure whether there is space avilable to store further element then how we do so that is why we say that size of aray can not be increased.

* Once array is declared with the specified size then it can not be increased on decreased later.

* To Increase the size of array there is only option that is create a new array and transfer all the elements from previous array to this new array.

* Note: We must delete the unused dynamic memory otherwise it will cause memory leakage problem.

* Operations on Array
  * Append
    * insert element at the end only.
  * Insert
  * Insert Only at Sorted Position
  * Display
  * Delete
  * Avg
  * Sum
  * Get
  * Set Replaces the element
  * Min
  * Max
  * Search (Liner and Binary)
  * Concatenate
  * Merge
  * Set Opeations on Array(Union,Intersection,Difference)
  * Reverse
    * Array can be reverse using two methods  
      * Method 1: With using an Auxiliary array
      * Method 2: In this method, first element is swapped with the last element and second with second last and third with third last and so on.
  * Rotation
    * Copy first element to the end of the array and it will continue.
    * Flashing the content on the LED screen is one of the example.
  * Shifting (Left Shift and Right Shift)
    * In shifting we loose element of either side if we shift left the we loose left element and if we shift right then we loos right element.

## String

What is character set and ASCII codes?

* It is the set of code that are supported by various programming languages.
* we know that computer only support binary language then how a computer can understand
  characters.
* For every characters there is predefined number associated that is what we know as ASCII codes.
* Those Numbers are standard number and every electronics device must follow and those numbers are only meant for electronic device communication.

## Linked List

Why Linked List?

* Linked List is used to store any type of elements unlike arrays which stores element from same domain.

* Linked List is fast as compare to array.

* Flexible as compared to array.

* It can grow and shrink on demand.

Array Vs Linked List  
|Array | Linked List  
|:-|:-|
|Arrays have limited size. |Linked List can grow and shrink dynamically.|
|Array stores only same type of element.|Linked List can store any type of data.|
|Array is primitive datastructure.|Linked List is Derived.|
|Array is a linear datastructure.|Linked List is also a linear datastructure.|

## Matrices

What is Matrices?  

* A matrices is an array of some kind of elements.  
* Matrix used to represent statistical data.
* Matrix mostly used in the field of computer science to represent various type of data.

## Tree
## Graph

* A graph G (V,E) is the set of vertices and edges.  
* There are various type of graph available, below are the some examples.  
  * Directed Graph
    * A directed graph is a graph that has some directions.
    * In directed graph edges are represented by arrows and they tells the directions.
  * Undirected Graph
    * An undirected graph is a graph that has no directions and the edges in undirected graph is simply represented by lines.
