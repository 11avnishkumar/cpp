# Programming using CPP and Datastructure

## What is a data structure?

Data Structure is -
A techninque to store elements so that they can be used efficiently and effectively.

## What is Recursion?

When a function call itself then it is called recursion.

* Recursion is costly because it uses stack internally.

## Array

* Array stores element in memory at contigious location.

* If we are not sure whether there is space avilable to store further element then how we do so that is why we say that size of aray can not be increased.

* Once array is declared with the specified size then it can not be increased on decreased later.

* To Increase the size of array there is only option that is create a new array and transfer all the elements from previous array to this new array.

* Note: We must delete the unused dynamic memory otherwise it will cause memory leakage problem.

## Linked List

Why Linked List?

* Linked List is used to store any type of elements unlike arrays which stores element from same domain.

* Linked List is fast as compare to array.
